These are instructions for downloading and building the Grid package, "develop" branch for use
with the MILC code.

Check the configure options for the desired build architecture in build.sh 

Then run 
   ./build.sh scalar|avx512|avx2 PK_CC PK_CXX

On Cray systems, use PK_CC = cc and PK_CXX = CC.  Also, be sure the modules
include compiler, architecture (KNL), and MPI support.  For example,

PrgEnv-intel/6.0.4 
craype-mic-knl 
cray-mpich/7.6.2
